user study 1: 

tried to hit enter to log in
asked what language the app uses
started typing right away without creating file first
entered in function and ran it. was confused when it didn't appear right away and clicked 	compile multiple times
saved the file
user didn't notice the buttons at the top

user study 2:
user thought that the placeholder text in the login was real text and tried to log in without a user name
asked what languages the app supported
user didn't know that he could click on the visualizations tab
user was unsure what the optimization option would do
user said he liked the clean design of the site since it was coding related and that the site did everything it was supposed to do.

user study 3:
didn't know what username to enter, she didn't know that the system automatically registers a user if they don't exist in the database
was unsure of what language it used
didn't know there was a visualizations tab on the site
clicked on compile many times because she didn't know why it took so long to return something
user was confused at what kind of optimizations the server would run on the code
user seemed a bit disappointed that the site didn't do a lot more with the code

conclusions:
add more user feedback so they know exactly what is going on
make the visualizations tab more prominent so users know that it is a button and not just text
be more clear in descriptions so users know what the site does

iteration:
added notification for compile that lets the user know the request was received
added more user feedback in the form of popup notifications
added clear tabbing for "visualization" and "compiled code" section for the site
added more description in README
